### `npm start`

The library Crawler will help you identify the most used Js libraries.

How does it work: 
    1 - You add some text and click on search
    2 - We will check with the google the 5 best ranking results
    3- With this data we will extrat the Html for this pages
    4- From the Html we will check the scripts included on the page
    5- Then we will match the most used Libraries
    6- You will be informed when the process ended with the result.



The current version 1 is on the 3 step -> we are having some issues with the cors.
But we already have the steps 4 and 5 in mind and some implementation done.


Thanks for visiting.
